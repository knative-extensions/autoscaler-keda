    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this block and unindented to actually change the configuration.

    # configures the default Prometheus address if no is specified per service
    autoscaler.keda.prometheus-address: "http://prometheus-operated.default.svc:9090"

    # configures the globally default mode for creating ScaledObject. Default is true.
    # If you set this to false make sure that you have a ScaledObject for each service
    # and existing services with a previously automatically created ScaledObject should
    # have their Knative service annotation `autoscaling.knative.dev/scaled-object-auto-create` set to true.
    # By setting `autoscaling.knative.dev/scaled-object-auto-create` at the Knative Service level you can bypass
    # this configuration and by setting to false you can bring your own scaled object.
